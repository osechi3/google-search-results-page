This page is built as a part of the HTML/CSS project on The Odin Project. This project is considered the difficult version of the previous one.

Learning Goals:
1. Getting experience of building of a long webpage
2. Getting comfortable with working with lists and navigation bars
3. Getting general experience of using pure HTML and CSS for building websites.

THE WEB PAGE IS UNFINISHED
It's due to some problems that I should have recognized in the beginning of the process. I ruined the structure of the document so I can't use the footer element to create a bottom navigation bar (At least I think so at the moment).
